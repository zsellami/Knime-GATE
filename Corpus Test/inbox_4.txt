RE: ISAS Meeting Agenda 2/14&15/2002
Ray and ISAS -  Just going through the past four days of email, so please excuse this response if it has been already addressed.  What was said at the Jan 17th meeting of the ESWG was, I (Bob Harshbarger) was not prepared to address the issues surrounding voting, membership, etc. at that meeting.  ESWG will have to adopt some form of structure if we are to proceed as quickly as the ESC.  The ESWG was formed at the direction of the Joint Guidance Committee.  We have been asked to consider formalized or structure membership based on the same guidelines that ISAS has been given.  The intent is not to leave anyone out but to ensure we can address issues in a timely manner.  There is no perfect solution.  A weighted sector voting structure does appear to give broader voice to the masses, yet even within a single sector the participants can opposing view points and still feel under represented. What the ESWG adopts is to be seen.
